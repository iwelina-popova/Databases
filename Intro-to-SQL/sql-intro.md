# Structured Query Language (SQL)

### What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
* SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
    * Consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language, and a data control language
    * The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control
* A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.
* A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.

### What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?
Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a standardized computer language that was originally developed by IBM for querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. These additional features make Transact-SQL Turing complete.
